This is based on the new rails template stuff by MR Neighborly

a really nice hack is to then do this: 

alias rails="ruby ~/src/git/rails/railties/bin/rails $1 -m http://github.com/imajes/rails-template/raw/master/rails_template.rb"

this works for me, for zsh.. similar i am sure will work for you

==================================================

This fork is even more opinionated.
It assumes:

 - haml, sass, compass, 960gs - default templates for login, layout etc.
 - uses a predefined form builder (air budd)
 - test with shoulda and rr.
 - use authlogic, searchlogic and aasm
 - give option for a default "site controller"
 - Use forgery instead of faker
 - default to my plugin with a bunch of helpers (e.g. Setting
   and the like).
 - Automatically add spawn and workling so I don't have to google.
 
All in all, It's bitching (atleast for me).
